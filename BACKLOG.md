# Backlog

A list of ideas of things we can add to this project

- [ ] Allow users to highlight the interop points in their project
- [ ] Make it so selecting a technology will filter the available technologies to only matching combinations (i.e. if a user selects `polymer` and all options that don't include it will drop off)
- [ ] Allow users to delete an individual tag (during add process)
- [ ] Allow technologies to provide a logo (to be surfaced alongside the technology name)
